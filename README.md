<b>ECG Heartbeat Classification Using CWT, CNN, and LSTM</b>

This project involves the development of a model combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect and classify different types of heartbeats in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. By leveraging advanced digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of heartbeat classification.

<b>Problem Statement</b>

Accurate detection and classification of heartbeats in ECG signals are crucial for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods often struggle with variability in heartbeat patterns. This project combines deep learning with DSP techniques to create a robust model for heartbeat classification.

<b>Objective</b>

Apply Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT): To extract time-frequency representations of ECG signals and create scalograms.<br>

Develop CNN and LSTM Models: To classify ECG signals into different types of heartbeats.<br>

Compare Performance: Between CNN and LSTM models to identify the best approach for classification accuracy.

<b>Model Architecture</b>

Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT):

Used for extracting scalograms from ECG signals, providing detailed time-frequency information for better signal analysis.

CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks):

Applied to the CWT scalograms for feature extraction and classification. The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 98%, outperforming other models in classifying heartbeats.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):

Used to capture temporal dependencies in ECG signals. However, LSTM achieved a slightly lower accuracy of 95%, compared to CNN.

<b>Technologies Used</b>
